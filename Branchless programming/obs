-> A branch in programming is something like a "if" statement, switch statement,
conditional operator, etc.
-> A branch occurs whenever the cpu has more than one path that it can take.
-> Usually the CPU just executes one statement after another, but a branch occurs when 
there's a condition and the CPU could potentially take one of two paths.
-> The reason that that's slow is because the CPU actually tries to stay ahead of where it's 
got to execute.
-> The CPU doesn't know which instructions to load and what it does is it 
guesses, It guesses which path to load and loads a bunch of instructions which
might be the instructions that it needs to execute, but on the other hand, 
It might actually be the wrong instructions (CPU will flush all of those instructions out
and it'll have to read the real path).
-> That flushing of the wrong path and the loading of the right real path actually
takes a lot of time (really slow but we can't perceive it because of how fast
CPUs are nowadays).
